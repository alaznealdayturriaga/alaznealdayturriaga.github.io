A wireframe is a simplified view of the content that will appear on screen. They describe interactions of screen-based products.

Wireframes __need__ to show what real content __will look like__
* What types of information go there?
* What are their relative priorities?

content = anything users may see or interact with

### Anatomy of wireframes
Wireframes represent __templates__ for content.

A template is a __unique configuration of content areas. 

#### Layer 1: Rectangles
Most basic wireframes: a page cut into smaller rectangles (content)

##### Content areas
Content areas are rectangles with a single purpose
* Structural areas: common elements that appear in every template
* Shared areas: structure that appears in more than one template
* Unique areas: templates with distinct purpose

All rectangles __MUST BE NAMED__

#### Layer 2: Rectangles with form 
Layer 2 gives a lay out to the rectangles: shows what the page could look like

Consider __width__ and __height__ of rectangles 

Decide priorities: choosing __placement__ and __how much space it takes__

##### Sample content
To show efficacy of templates
* there are different types of sample content

When incorporating sample content, rectangles can __lose borders__

##### Functional elements
Communicate nature of interaction

They have more than one __state__: clicked/not clicked; active/inactive...
 * It's helpful to create a little detailed wireframe to show each of the states 

 #### Layer 3: Beyond rectangles 
 This 3rd layer polishes the wireframes, but they are __not necessary__

 ##### Grids
 Grids help set a visual framework for the alignment of the elements on the page

##### Priorization styles
Priorization can go by: typography, grayscale, line weight etc.

### Creating wireframes
Decisions to make:
* SCALE: a wireframe not always represents a whole page
* FIDELITY: how faithful the representation is
    * Hi-fi: wireframe looks like the final version
    * Lo-fi: rectangles with labels. Not showing the final style of the page
* ABSTRACTION: sometimes abstract sample content describes better the functionality of the areas
* DEPTH: variations for more information
* PURPOSE: 
    * Blueprints: give developers details to build the pages
    * Concept: for feedback about the design
* AUDIENCE: people that work with wireframes, __not the users__
* TIPS:
    * Sketch: initial ideas so that you can set directions
    * Establish purpose for the page: central focus
    * Recall design principles
    * List page contents
    * Use realistic scenarios: one wireframe for each. That means that if there are 30 variations, there must be 30 wireframes about them.
