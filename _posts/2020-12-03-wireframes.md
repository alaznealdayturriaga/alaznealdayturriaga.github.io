A wireframe is a simplified view of the content that will appear on screen. They describe interactions of screen-based products.

Wireframes __need__ to show what real content __will look like__
* What types of information go there?
* What are their relative priorities?

content = anything users may see or interact with

### Anatomy of wireframes
Wireframes represent __templates__ for content.

A template is a __unique configuration of content areas. 

#### Layer 1: Rectangles
Most basic wireframes: a page cut into smaller rectangles (content)

##### Content areas
Content areas are rectangles with a single purpose
* Structural areas: common elements that appear in every template
* Shared areas: structure that appears in more than one template
* Unique areas: templates with distinct purpose

All rectangles __MUST BE NAMED__

#### Layer 2: Rectangles with form 
Layer 2 gives a lay out to the rectangles: shows what the page could look like

Consider __width__ and __height__ of rectangles 

Decide priorities: choosing __placement__ and __how much space it takes__

##### Sample content
To show efficacy of templates
* there are different types of sample content

When incorporating sample content, rectangles can __lose borders__

##### Functional elements
Communicate nature of interaction
